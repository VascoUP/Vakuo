Hello! I am Tommy, a NASA astronaut.
Planet Earth has been targeted by an alien race that wants to conquer several planets in the Milky Way
So I was hired by NASA to transport a group of animals to a nearby planet 
that seems to be a safe haven for the selected animal species.
After a sudden landing on the planet Kepner-453c, all the animals were scattered around the planet
and now I have to find them...
Can you help me find the animals?
